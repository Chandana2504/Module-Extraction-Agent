# QA-Agent
It is an AI-powered solution built using Google Gemini, LangChain, and FAISS to extract structured module and submodule information from Help Center website. The agent crawls the help documentation, semantically indexes the content, and parses it to return a well-organized JSON structure representing the modules, their descriptions, and submodules.
